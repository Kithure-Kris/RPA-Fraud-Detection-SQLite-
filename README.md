DATA ACQUISITION
RPA Fraud Detection
Reputable Product Agency (RPA) has started receiving complaints from their credit card processor about fraudulent transactions. 
We are helping the finance department identify potentially risky transactions before they finish processing.

I'm using SQLite to query the data.
This dataset contains a single table, transaction_data.
