RPA Fraud Detection

Reputable Product Agency (RPA) has started receiving complaints from their credit card processor about fraudulent transactions. 
We are helping the finance department identify potentially risky transactions before they finish processing.
The marketing department of Reputable Product Agency (RPA) is also looking to segment the company users by a number of different criteria.

I'm using SQLite to query the data.
This dataset contains a single table, transaction_data.
